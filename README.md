Android Network Application
=========================

Sample Android network application that uses [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/tools/data-binding/guide.html).

## Network setup

Uses [JSON Generator](http://www.json-generator.com/) for it's remote data source.

Use the [json-gen.txt](json-gen.txt) to generate the data source again, if it fails to load.

### Helpful links

- [DataBinding Guide](https://developer.android.com/tools/data-binding/guide.html)
- [Realm.io with developers from Google](https://realm.io/news/data-binding-android-boyar-mount/) - helped me understand `BindingAdapter` and other advanced stuff.
